Hello! I am beginning a 100-day coding journey to step outside of my element and focus on my own projects.
For the past year, I have been learning Javascript and Node as well as other popular frameworks and libraries like React, Express, and Mongo.

Every day I will focus as much time as possible to improving my development skills!
